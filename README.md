<h2>What is Numpy?</h2>
- It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object such as a matrix or a masked array
- It also provides a variety of fast operations which can be done on these arrays to derive useful information
- At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object
- This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types

<h2>Why do we use Numpy?</h2>
- It provides efficient storage
- Provides better ways of handling data
- It's fast
- Uses lesser memory to store data

<h2>Differences between numpy arrays and python lists</h2>
- NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists which can grow dynamically
- Elements in a numpy array are required to be of the same datatype unlike lists which are hetrogeneous
- We can use advanced mathematics on numpy arrays whereas these don't work on lists
