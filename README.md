<h2>What is Numpy?</h2>
->It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object such as a matrix or a masked array.<br>
->It also provides a variety of fast operations whuch can be done on these arrays to derive udeful information.<br>
->At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object.<br>
->This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types.<br>

<h2>Why do we use Numpy?</h2>
->It provides efficient storage<br>
->Provides better ways of handling data<br>
->It's fast<br>
->Uses lesser memory to store data<br>

<h2>Differences between numpy arrays and python lists</h2>
->NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists which can grow dynamically.<br>
->Elements in a numpy array are required to be of the same datatype unlike lists which are hetrogeneous.<br>
->We can use advanced mathematics on numpy arrays whereas these don't work on lists.<br>
