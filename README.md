## What is Numpy?
1. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object such as a matrix or a masked array
2. It also provides a variety of fast operations which can be done on these arrays to derive useful information
3. At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object
4. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types

## Why do we use Numpy?
1. It provides efficient storage
2. Provides better ways of handling data
3. It's fast
4. Uses lesser memory to store data

## Differences between numpy arrays and python lists
1. NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists which can grow dynamically
2. Elements in a numpy array are required to be of the same datatype unlike lists which are hetrogeneous
3. We can use advanced mathematics on numpy arrays whereas these don't work on lists
